My current TODOs:
- Optimize Draw Calls

## Image Import Settings
- in the `Default` section it's best to have `Compression` set to `None`.  
- Under `Advanced`, make sure `Read/Write Enabled` is checked. â˜‘ 

## Next Step
When you right click a valid texture (such as a sprite sheet) > Click `Create` > and select `Color Palette`.

## How It Works
The `Color Paltte` is a custom Asset Utilitiy which samples unique colors from the selected texture, scanning it from the upper-left-most point and working its way to the right, then down. Kind of like a typewriter. In the example scene, the image file isolates every last color in the sprite in order to optimize the scan.


It scans the entire image for unique colors, and outputs a color palette object...


which you can then place on any sprite containing the `Palette Swapper` script.

The fewer amount of colors your spritesheet has, the easier it will be, but it's all up to you.

Once you have a new palette, simply use the color picker in the `New Color` column to replace the original colors, and apply the new palette to your gameobject. 

No need to reanimate a ready-to-play sprite.
